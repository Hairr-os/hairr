* Version: 1.1

 * Status: Draft
1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for hairr os, a next-generation, secure, and AI-native operating system. The project's vision is to build a new OS from the ground up, moving away from legacy monolithic designs to address the security, modularity, and performance demands of future computing.
hairr os is architected on four core principles:
 * Security by Design: A Rust-based, microkernel architecture with a capability-based security model to create a fundamentally secure and reliable platform.
 * Universal Adaptability: A modular design intended to scale seamlessly from resource-constrained wearables like smart glasses to high-performance desktops and servers.
 * Future-Native Integration: First-class, native support for Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and decentralized identity.
 * Seamless Compatibility: A commitment to user comfort and developer adoption by providing broad application compatibility through a dedicated, sandboxed compatibility suite.
## 1.1 Architectural Principles & Project Structure
To ensure minimal long-term maintenance effort and a streamlined development process, the project must adhere to the following structural principles:
 * Monorepo with Workspaces: The entire core OS (kernel, services, drivers, shared libraries) must be developed within a single Git repository, leveraging Cargo workspaces. This approach is critical for ensuring atomic commits, unified testing, and simplified dependency management across tightly coupled components.
 * Protocol-Centric HAL: The Hardware Abstraction Layer must be defined by a set of stable, versioned Rust traits (protocols). This decouples the core OS from specific hardware, allowing vendors to develop drivers independently and simplifying porting efforts.
 * API-First Services: All system services (package management, compatibility suite, etc.) must expose their functionality through stable, well-documented IPC-based APIs. This allows for interchangeable components and empowers third-party development (e.g., alternative app stores).
A sample project directory structure would be:
hairr-os/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml          # The root workspace manifest
â”œâ”€â”€ kernel/             # The microkernel
â”œâ”€â”€ libs/               # Shared libraries (IPC, HAL traits, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/           # Core userspace services (device manager, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ drivers/            # Userspace device drivers
â”œâ”€â”€ shell/              # The desktop shell and basic utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ compatibility/      # The Linux/Android compatibility suite
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg-manager/        # The native package management service and client
â””â”€â”€ apps/               # The first-party App Store and other native apps

2. Goals and Objectives
 * Product Goal: To create a technically superior, open-source operating system that becomes a leading platform for developing secure, high-performance applications.
 * Business Goal: To foster a vibrant ecosystem of hardware partners and application developers, driven by both novel native features and excellent backward compatibility.
 * Technical Goals:
   * Achieve a new standard in OS security and fault isolation.
   * Deliver a unified platform that provides hard real-time guarantees for mixed-criticality workloads.
   * Abstract hardware complexity for AI/ML developers.
   * Ensure broad application compatibility to ease user transition and support legacy software.

FR-5: User Experience
| ID | Requirement | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Desktop Environment | The OS must provide a modern, multi-tasking desktop environment. | Must-have |
| 5.2 | Smart Glasses Form Factor | The OS must run efficiently on resource-constrained smart glasses. | Must-have |
| 5.3 | Hands-Free HCI | For smart glasses, the OS must provide first-class, low-level support for hands-free input methods (speech, gesture, eye tracking). | Must-have |
| 5.4 | Seamless System Updates | The OS must implement a robust, seamless update mechanism (e.g., an A/B partition scheme) that allows for automatic background updates and safe rollbacks in case of failure. | High |
| 5.5 | Privacy-Preserving Telemetry | The OS should include an opt-in telemetry and crash reporting service to help developers improve the system, with clear, transparent privacy controls for the user. | Should-have |
FR-6: Application Compatibility Suite ("Chrysalis") ðŸ’»
| ID | Requirement | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Linux & Android Support | The OS must offer an optional compatibility suite, "Chrysalis," capable of running unmodified Linux and Android applications. | Must-have |
| 6.2 | Virtualization-Based | The suite must leverage virtualization and sandboxing technologies to run guest environments. This ensures strong isolation from the host hairr os and maintains system security. | Must-have |
| 6.3 | On-Demand Installation | Chrysalis should be user-installable via the package manager. Furthermore, the OS must be able to detect attempts to run foreign binaries (e.g., .deb, .apk, ELF) and prompt the user to automatically install the required compatibility components. | High |
| 6.4 | Docker Support | The Linux compatibility layer must be sufficient to support running the Docker daemon and standard Linux containers. | High |
FR-7: Package Management & Distribution ðŸ“¦
| ID | Requirement | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Native Package Manager | The OS must include a native package manager with a command-line interface (CLI) for installing, updating, and removing software. | Must-have |
| 7.2 | First-Party App Store | The OS must feature a first-party graphical App Store for discovering and managing applications. | High |
| 7.3 | API for Third-Party Stores | The underlying package installation service must expose a secure, capability-gated API. This must allow third-party organizations to build and operate their own alternative app stores or package managers on hairr os. | Must-have |
5. Non-Functional Requirements
(No changes from version 1.0, with the addition of NFR-6)
| ID | Requirement Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | Performance | IPC mechanism must be highly performant. The system must provide hard real-time guarantees. |
| NFR-2 | Reliability | A crash in a userspace component must not crash the kernel or other isolated components. |
| NFR-3 | Maintainability | The codebase must be highly modular and maintainable by a distributed, open-source community. |
| NFR-4 | Portability | The HAL must be designed to minimize porting effort to new CPU architectures. |
| NFR-5 | Open Source | The project must use a permissive open-source license and have excellent documentation. |
| NFR-6 | Minimalism | Core OS features should be minimal. Non-essential, heavy features like the Chrysalis suite must be optional, installable components, ensuring the base system remains lightweight and fast. |
